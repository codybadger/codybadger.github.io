[Here](/brewing/YosemiteFallsDoubleNutBrown.htm) is my favorite recipe to brew at the moment. I've brewed about 50 batches of beer at home since I started brewing. I've also brewed many batches with my time at Brewbot.

At home, my current system is a keggle and ice chest mash tuns. Here's a photo of Matt fly-sparging some of that Double Nut Brown (link above.)

And here is my keggle:

I had six carboys fermenting at once in my fermentation room:

I dispense everything through my two-tap kegerator, but I also built a four-tap jockey box for any off-site dispensing:

I'm working on the design for my all-electric homebrew setup, and will post photos in a few weeks when the design is a little more complete.
