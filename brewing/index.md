[Here](/brewing/YosemiteFallsDoubleNutBrown.htm) is my favorite recipe to brew at the moment. I've brewed about 50 batches of beer at home since I started brewing. I've also brewed many batches with my time at Brewbot.

At home, my current system is a keggle and ice chest mash tuns. Here's a photo of Matt fly-sparging some of that Double Nut Brown (link above.)

I sometimes brew on Brewbot. And by sometimes, I mean all the time. That's because I work for Brewbot, and I get paid to do it. Brewbot is an automated 3-vessel brewing system that makes about 6.5 gallon batches. Marie is helping me out in this photo by texting selfies to all of her friends!

I had six carboys fermenting at once in my fermentation room:

I dispense everything through my two-tap kegerator, but I also built a four-tap jockey box for any off-site dispensing:

Here's a photo of my old fermentation chamber. I had to make it taller to fit the air lock, so I added the 2x10" collar around the top. The compressor died while I was out of the country, so I gave it away on Craigslist.

I had destroyed an old kegerator on accident, so I decided to turn that into a new and improved fermentation chamber. This one uses labview to regulate temperature of the wort. Cooling is done by the refrigerator compressor, I have a carboy heating band for heating, and there's a thermowell with a thermocouple inside for my temperature reading.

I'm working on the design for my all-electric homebrew setup, and will post photos in a few weeks when the design is a little more complete.
