My responsibilities included comprehensive testing of various sensor systems including lidar, radar, microphones, and cameras, as well as contributing to specialized vehicle projects for delivery and accessibility applications.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_cruise.png" alt="Cruise A110" style="width:600px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>Loon</h2> <p>Loon developed a network of high-altitude balloons to provide LTE connectivity to underserved communities worldwide and during emergency situations.</p> <p>I served as the Reliability Test Team Lead at <a href="http://www.loon.co">Loon</a> for three years, managing a team of four engineers. Our team conducted comprehensive hardware reliability testing, primarily at the component level, utilizing environmental chambers for long-term validation of flight avionics hardware, LTE components, and electromechanical systems. As team lead, I ensured timely delivery of high-quality test results and maintained rigorous testing standards.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_loon.png" alt="The Balloon" style="width:600px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>Industrial Optic</h2> <p><a href="http://www.industrialoptic.com">Industrial Optic</a> was a startup I co-founded, which was subsequently acquired by Mueller in 2018. I dedicated eighteen months to developing a non-invasive solution for repairing leaks in municipal drinking water distribution systems. Our team developed an innovative leak detection and repair delivery system that deployed through existing fire hydrants. As the first employee and Mechanical Engineering Lead, I conducted the initial technical feasibility assessment and led the mechanical design efforts. Leveraging Bay Area rapid prototyping capabilities, we successfully developed three functional prototypes within twelve months.</p> <p>Beyond the robotic delivery system, we developed and patented a novel repair methodology for internal pipe leak remediation. This technology enabled in-situ leak repair without service disruption or excavation, utilizing a stent-based approach adapted for pressure pipe applications.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_industrial_optic_cad.png" alt="IO CAD" style="width:300px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_industrial_optic_real.jpg" alt="IO Real" style="width:300px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>Brewbot</h2> <p>In 2015, I relocated to Belfast, Northern Ireland, to join <a href="http://www.brewbot.io">Brewbot</a> as a mechanical engineer. I contributed to the development of an automated, smartphone-controlled brewing system. Our team successfully progressed from concept to production-ready Version 1.0 within twelve months. This experience provided valuable exposure to startup dynamics, including rapid development cycles, resource constraints, funding challenges, and the demands of bringing a consumer product to market.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_brewbot_cad.jpg" alt="CAD Brewbot" style="width:300px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_brewbot.jpg" alt="Real Brewbot" style="width:300px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>Modular Science</h2> <p>At Modular Science, I contributed to the development of a cost-effective biotech laboratory benchtop assistant, designed to provide accessible automation solutions for resource-constrained research environments. Our team employed an iterative design methodology emphasizing rapid physical prototyping over extensive CAD modeling. This approach enabled design modifications, laser cutting fabrication, assembly, and evaluation cycles to be completed within one week, significantly accelerating development timelines.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/modular_science.jpg" alt="The Machine" style="width:450px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>Tesla Motors</h2> <p>As a member of Tesla's Vehicle Test team, I conducted comprehensive testing on Model S Beta and Release Candidate vehicles. My primary responsibility involved executing full-lifetime durability assessments on pre-production units. Working alongside drivers and technicians, our team identified and documented potential reliability issues during extensive eight-month testing protocols. I contributed to meeting critical company milestones through dedicated testing efforts, including extended track testing sessions. My comprehensive 480-page test report established new standards for thoroughness within the department.</p> <p>Our methodology integrated quantitative vehicle data with qualitative observations to provide comprehensive issue characterization. These findings were analyzed collaboratively with design and manufacturing teams to determine root causes and implement effective solutions.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_tesla.jpg" alt="Tesla Model S" style="width:400px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>CNH</h2> <p>As a Stress Test Engineer at CNH (Case New Holland), I conducted structural stress analysis on heavy construction equipment across global testing locations. My responsibilities included measuring stress responses to impacts and vibrations, and performing fatigue life assessments for various machine components. I collaborated closely with the Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) team and eventually transitioned to an NVH engineering role.</p> <p>My testing protocols involved strain measurement of structural members under diverse loading conditions and comprehensive structural analysis of results. I also conducted vibration testing on electronic components, measuring acceleration responses during various operational scenarios and comparing results against specifications. Testing conditions ranged from standard operational environments to extreme scenarios, including controlled drop tests of 32-ton tractors from four-foot heights.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="/images/portfolio_case.png" alt="Case Construction Equipment" style="width:400px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"> </div> <h2>Zero Motorcycles</h2> <p>I served as a Powertrain Test Engineer at Zero Motorcycles from 2021-2022, supporting the strategic partnership between Zero and Polaris.
