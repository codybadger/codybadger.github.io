Greetings,

In 2011, I worked at Zero Motorcycles as a Production Technician and as a Mechanical Engineering Intern under Derek Yuen. I saw the postings for the [Mechanical Engineers (III and V) and Test Engineer](http://www.zeromotorcycles.com/company/employment.php) that are open, and I wanted to apply.

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with experience in test and design, and a significant part of that was in the automotive industry. I graduated with a Bachelors and a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA. Since leaving Zero, I've obtained a lot of other skills; working on heavy equipment, electric cars, biotech robotics, and craft beer robotics.

Currently, I'm the Lead Hardware Engineer at the Northern Irish startup, [Brewbot](www.brewbot.io). Our goal is to develop a *distributed brewery*; a network of small breweries that brew keg-sized batches that would replace distributing the beer itself. We've developed a the hardware and software to automate the beer brewing process via a smartphone app. It's really fun. The "internet-of-things" turn that my career has taken has been interesting, but I'd eventually like to get back into the EV sector.

Some Zero employees may remember that I started at Zero working in production, building sub-assemblies and full bikes. After a month, I moved over to the engineering team and helped bring parts from it's conceptual phase, through the design process and prototype testing, and finally to releasing the parts into the final 2012 product.

After Zero, I moved to Chicago and performed structural and vibrational tests on heavy construction equipment in the midwest and India with CNH (think Caterpillar or John Deere.) A lot of my time was spent doing stress testing and lifetime predictions using strain data acquired during field operations. I also did some NVH testing as well. My tasks involved test planning, instrument installation (strain gauges, RPM sensors, pressure transducers, accelerometers, thermocouples, CAN recording, etc), data acquisition, data analysis, and producing reports and presentations about the results. These were usually component level tests that were often times carried out on a full machine.

A position at Tesla Motors brought me back to California, where I was a reliability and durability test engineer in charge of validating the Tesla Model S before and during production. Whereas my work at CNH was geared toward more specific components, at Tesla I had long term tests simulating a complete vehicle lifetime, and issues or failures would arise periodically. To resolve the issues, I worked with design engineers to troubleshoot the root cause.

I really enjoy building and tinkering, and consider myself a pretty well rounded handyman. I work construction from time to time. I've rebuilt my engine twice (one time it blew up while driving to Zero when I worked there). I also like to restore antique machinery like bicycles, motorcycles, or shop tools. I sometimes build furniture in my spare time. I'm quite organized and meticulous. I'm outdoorsy and respect our resources. When I'm out and about, I enjoy things like backpacking, skiing, canoeing, organized sport, hiking, fishing, and diving.

I grew up in Santa Cruz, and love the area. I had a blast working at Zero, and would love to go back and talk to the team to see if it'd still be a good fit for me.

Best regards,
