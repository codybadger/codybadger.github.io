  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I grew up in Santa Cruz, California, where I developed a passion for baseball, basketball, and skiing. I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering at UCLA, where I also competed on the Ultimate Frisbee team for four years as a deep cutter. My international experience includes extended stays in Córdoba, Spain; Mendoza, Argentina; Huanchaco, Peru; Juayúa, El Salvador; and Belfast, Northern Ireland, as well as living in various U.S. cities including Santa Cruz, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Through nearly three years of living and traveling in Spanish-speaking countries, I developed fluency in Spanish.</p>

  <p>My engineering career has spanned diverse industries and applications. I have experience in electric motorcycle parts design, stress and NVH testing on heavy machinery, reliability and durability testing on the Tesla Model S, biotech laboratory automation, mechanical engineering leadership in the beer technology sector, and industrial pipe repair robotics. My volunteer work has taken me to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where I helped develop water catchment and delivery systems for rural farming communities. Additional work experience includes restaurant management in San Francisco, UCLA bus driving, and seafood market operations. Check out my CV or Portfolio page for more details on my professional experience.</p>

  <p>I previously maintained an active homebrewing practice, at one point managing ten full carboys fermenting five different beer styles for weddings. My brewing focused primarily on darker ales, including watermelon hefeweizen, double nut brown ale, barrel-aged scotch ale, coffee oatmeal stout, and double IPA.</p>

  <p>I enjoy an active lifestyle with sports and skiing as primary interests. I also have a passion for mechanical restoration and have rebuilt car engines, bicycles, and woodworking machines. I regularly participate in abalone diving, crabbing, spearfishing, and clamming along the Northern California coast. I'm an avid camper and once completed an 18-day, 400-kilometer trek through the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p>

  <p>On a personal level, I value honesty, kindness, and meaningful connections. I strive to incorporate these values across all my relationships—professional, personal, and familial—believing that quality time spent in good company represents life's greatest reward.</p>

  <h1>Travel</h1>

  <p>I have a deep appreciation for exploration in all its forms, whether it's discovering the trails behind my house or traveling across the world to explore new landscapes. I have visited 34 countries and lived in six, gaining invaluable perspective through diverse cultural experiences. I maintain an older <a href="http://codybadgertravel.blogspot.com/">travel blog</a> that documents some of these adventures, which I may eventually migrate to this site.</p>

  <p>Here is a gallery of some photos I've taken.</p>
