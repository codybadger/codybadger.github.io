Very well maintained, no issues at all.

I'm the third owner, and I've owned this car since 2018, and have put 34,000 miles on it for camping and ski trips. The previous owner bought it new, and just used it in and around Santa Cruz, from what I remember. I had a 4Runner before this, but when my daughter was born, I needed a little more space, and this provided perfectly. These first generation Sequoias are fantastic, and this one is especially clean and has all the features you'd want. I used to have a roof cargo rack (sold it), and have taken things all over California with the vehicle. I've seen some people turn these into overlander type vehicles, but I never really got into that with this. Just a bunch of short trips up the coast or to the Sierras. Fantastic power and performance - it handles snow really well. I'll add some photos of how I've loaded things onto it.

I live in SF, but I really only drive it here when I'm on my way into or out of town - it's not a city car. I don't commute with it, nor do I run errands with it; I use my Chevy Bolt for that.

I'm selling it because I also have a pickup truck with a 4 Wheel Camper on it, and that's our main weekend vehicle now.
