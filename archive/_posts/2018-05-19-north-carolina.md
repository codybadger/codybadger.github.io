Alright. I'm currently 0 - 3 on my blog posts. My goal here was to provide periodical updates to my life here. After about two years of maintaining this website, I think a more reasonable goal here is to use the "blog" as a trip write up repository. I'd like to document backpacking trips, camping trips, and other random trips I've taken, partly for my own benefit, but also for others to see.

Here are the trips I'd like to document:

* Black Canyon, Spring 2007
* Yosemite, Spring 2018
* Yosemite, Spring 2017
* JMT, Summer 2007
* Emigrant Wilderness, Summer 2017
* Emigrant Wilderness, Summer 2014
* Lost Coast, Summer 2015
* Lost Coast, Summer 2009
* Hell Hole, 2001 - present

I'm gonna start with this list, and see how it goes.
